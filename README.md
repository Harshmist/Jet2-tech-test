# Jet2-tech-test

My completed technical test for a Front End Developer role with Jet2.

The brief was to create a confirmation Modal that would acivate upon a button being clicked.
There were also set criteria for how the modal should appear when viewed from a mobile device.

For this I used Bootstrap and the styling was done using sass.

I decided to go beyond the brief of just creating the button and created an imitation of the Jet2 site's nav bar and banner, complete with identical styling.
